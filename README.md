## Motivation

Over the time while developing projects that requires different stacks(frontend, mobile, extension, desktop, api, scraper etc.) I found myself repeating and not being productive because of all the effort to maintain repo chores. This is an effort to end the pain...

## Goals

- Use most popular templates/libraries/frameworks
- Try to be unopiniated as much as possible
- Do not include unnecessary logic/code

## Using this example

### Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Development

```
pnpm dev
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

#### Apps
