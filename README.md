## üöÄ Motivation

As a creator and relentless dreamer, navigating the intricate process of crafting complete products felt overwhelming. Developing frontend, backend, mobile, Scraper, and various components for each repository seemed like a series of separate battles and redundant efforts. I envisioned a space where the challenges of developing entire products could be addressed directly. A place where collaboration flowed naturally, contracts seamlessly, and tooling was a boon rather than a necessary evil.

## üéØ Goals
- **Technology Agnostic:** Use your preferred tech stack - be it Vercel, GCP, AWS, Supabase, Firebase, Prisma, Drizzle, etc.
- **Ease of Use:** No boilerplate code, no unnecessary folder structures - just simplicity.
- **Frameworks with Community Support:** Leverage widely-used frameworks with large communities such as Next.js, Nest.js, React Native, Electron, Playwright, and Plasmo.
